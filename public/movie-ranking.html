<h1>The Best Movies According to Austin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Step Brothers</h3>
<p>Raunchy comedy, as a forewarning. Non-stop laughs.</p>

<h3>Remember The Titans</h3>
<p>A team overcoming differences to dominate the competition.</p>

<h3>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</h3>
<p>I clearly like "so dumb it is funny" movies. That sums this movie up.</p>
